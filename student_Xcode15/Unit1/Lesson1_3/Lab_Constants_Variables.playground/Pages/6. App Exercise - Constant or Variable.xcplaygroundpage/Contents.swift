/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let userName = "Carlos Icaza"
print("constant because the name does not change")
var userAge = 52
print("variable because the year change the older you get")
var numberOfStepsTakenToday = 15000
print("variable because the number of steps change depending on the circunstance")
let dailyGoalOfNumberOfSteps = 30000
print("constant because is a value prefixed by the user")
var averageHeartRate = 180
print("variable because")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
